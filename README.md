Using Regression for Determing Rings From Abalone Data

Abalone are marine snails which are widely consumed as food. The age of abalone may be determined by cutting the shell
through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope. This is a time-consuming task. It
would be advantageous if other measurements, which are easier to obtain, could be used to predict the number of rings,
and therefore the age. The abalone dataset contains information for 4177 abalone. For each observation nine variables
are recorded. The objective is to use the available explanatory variables to predict the number of rings.

The Abalone dataset contains 9 Variables for 4177 abalone:
Sex : M = Male, F = Female, I = Infant
Length : Longest shell measurement (mm)
Diameter : Measurement of shell perpendicular to length (mm)
Height : Height of shell, with meat in shell (mm)
Whole weight : Weight of whole abalone (grams)
Shucked weight : Weight of meat (grams)
Viscera weight : Gut weight (after bleeding) (grams)
Shell weight : Shell weight after being dried (grams)
Rings : Number of rings in shell (# rings +1.5 gives the age in years)
